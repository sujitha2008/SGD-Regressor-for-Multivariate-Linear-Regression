# SGD-Regressor-for-Multivariate-Linear-Regression

## AIM:
To write a program to predict the price of the house and number of occupants in the house with SGD regressor.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
1. Data Preparation: Load the California housing dataset, extract features (first three columns) and targets (target variable and sixth column), and split the data into training and testing sets.

2. Data Scaling: Standardize the feature and target data using StandardScaler to enhance model performance.

3. Model Training: Create a multi-output regression model with SGDRegressor and fit it to the training data.

4. Prediction and Evaluation: Predict values for the test set using the trained model, calculate the mean squared error, and print the predictions along with the squared error.

## Program:

Y_pred = model.predict(X_test)


mse = mean_squared_error(Y_test, Y_pred)
